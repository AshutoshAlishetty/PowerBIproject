# PowerBIproject
My First Power BI Dashboard project on Sales for a Superstore
I referred to a Youtube Channel to create these projects as I was new to Power BI.
I downloaded the dataset and started to examine the dataset in excel and then later on I uploaded the dataset to PowerBI.
Then I started to clean and transform the data in the Power BI Power Query editorand then sorted the columns and removed the duplicates and then check the datatypes of the columns and then made the final changes to the dataset.
Then I started to visualze the dashboard by the metrics through which i can gain insights and started to prepare them by creating different type of charts and then formatting them for a better visual appeal
and then adjusting them into a proper format and then complete my furst PowerBI project.
